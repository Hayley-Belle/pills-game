Known bugs:
Moving horizontal and colliding with a tile will result in next jump not carrying HorizontalVelocity. Resulting in 
a vertical jump... Have to repress move to gain horizontal movement again.

v0.1 - Collision seems to be working. Can still move through blocks when holding the movement keys down.
